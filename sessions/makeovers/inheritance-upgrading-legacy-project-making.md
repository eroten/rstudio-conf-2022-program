<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

It happens to us all - a request for a quick update turns into a project nightmare.
In this talk, I show you how to turn any project into a point of pride.
Using a worked example, I provide guidance on completing a project intake and 
how to work efficiently and reproducibly through thoughtful documentation. 
I cover how to set up the project for future success. Learn how to take the mundane project you dread and make it inexcplicably satisfying.
